    Hey, I’m Christopher Calixte. I'm a computer science student who’s really into tech and learning how to use it to make my life easier. I like working on software, messing with cloud stuff, digging into cybersecurity, and learning how networks and systems run behind the scenes.

    </p>
    <p>
    I try to hold myself accountable and always strive to improve, whether it’s learning something new, fixing something that’s broken, or refining my skills in software development and system administration.
    </p>

    P.S. Ask me about my homelab
